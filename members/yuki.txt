Hi, I am Yuki Matsumura.

I am a graduate student at Michigan State University from Japan.

Please let me know if you have any questions about going to college or studying abroad.

I was homeschooled until the 5th grade and then attended a community college in California, where I unsuccessfully tried to pursue a career as an actress... 
But now I am interested in physics and getting computational skills!

I enjoy cooking on the weekends, and I love coffee!
